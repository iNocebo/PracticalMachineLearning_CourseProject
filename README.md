# PracticalMachineLearning_CourseProject
This project is part of Coursera’s Practical Machine Learning within the “Data Science” specialisation by Jeff Leek, PhD, Roger D. Peng, PhD, Brian Caffo, PhD, of Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health.
# Executive Summary 
In this project we created a machine learning algorithm capable of distinguishing the quality of exercise execution. The prediction is based on measurements of devices applied to the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell during exercise execution. The random forest model with 53 predictors is capable to predict the class of execution with an out of sample error of 0.79 %.
